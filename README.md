# AI_for_Business_Insights

Individual undergraduate inter-disciplinary reserach project guided under Asst Prof Cheong Foong Soon from Nanyang Business Scool. This project investigates how artificial intelligence can be applied to infer meaning from words. 

This is immensely useful because a large bulk of business insights in corporate disclosures (e.g., annual reports) are in the unstructured textual format (e.g., management discussion), and not in a structured form (e.g., tables of numbers).

This project focuses on two main dataset, sec edgar and Bloomberg.
